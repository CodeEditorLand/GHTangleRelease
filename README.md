# GitHub Action to Add Release Metadata to The IOTA Tangle

This GitHub Action will take the contents of your GitHub release and create an associated Transactions on the IOTA Tangle. This way the data associated with the release becomes immutable.

## Usage

Create a GitHub workflow in you repo e.g. `/.github/workflows/tangle-release.tml`

```yaml
on:
  push:
    # Sequence of patterns matched against refs/tags
    tags:
      - 'v*' # Push events to matching v*, i.e. v1.0, v20.15.10

name: Create Release

jobs:
  build:
    name: Create Tangle Release
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: Create Release
        id: create_release
        uses: actions/create-release@v1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # This token is provided by Actions, you do not need to create your own token
        with:
          tag_name: ${{ github.ref }}
          release_name: Release ${{ github.ref }}
          body: |
            Changes in this Release
            - First Change
            - Second Change
          draft: false
          prerelease: false
```
